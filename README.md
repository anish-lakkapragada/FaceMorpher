# Okay so the cheat sheet is just first

1) get data prepared in the format that it needs to be in (64 x 64 x 3)

- save all these images inside of a pickle file (20000k x 64 x 64 x 3) numpy array rip 

2) create and design the generator and discriminator with pytorch. we can train with DCGAN or some other technology.

- write the train code 

1) train the generator to generate awesome stuff. 

2) brainstorm then what fun things you can do (add images, subtract images, etc. ) for the API 

3) web development with svelte and the index page. 

4) host on github.
